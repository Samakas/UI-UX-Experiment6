# UI-UX-Experiment6

## Aim:
To practice solution ideation, user story creation, scenario development, flow mapping, and information architecture design to improve user experience through structured UX design activities.
## Algorithm:
1.Solution Ideation: Use a known UX problem (e.g., booking an appointment in a hospital app). Task: Conduct crazy 8s or brainwriting ideation exercise. Generate multiple low-fidelity ideas.

2.Creating User Stories: Use personas and their goals to write user stories. Task: Write at least 5 user stories using this format: As a [user], I want to [goal], so that [benefit].

3.Creating Scenarios: Select a user story. Task: Create a narrative scenario that describes the user in context. Include emotional states, tasks, and environment.

4.Flow Diagrams / Flow Mapping: Choose a task (e.g., ordering food via app). Task: Draw a task flow diagram or user flow. Use standard symbols (start, decision, action, etc.).

5.Information Architecture (IA): Take an example website or app (e.g., university site, news portal). Task: Perform card sorting (open or closed). Create a site map showing categorized structure.



## Output:
## Solution Ideation
Problem Statement: Public transport users often face challenges with existing apps, including inaccurate real-time tracking, confusing route planning, difficulty finding fare information, and a lack of personalized updates, leading to frustration and missed connections.

## Ideation Exercise: Crazy 8s (Adapted for Text)

Here are 8 quick low-fidelity ideas for solving the public transport app UX problem:

"One-Tap Commute" Widget: A customizable widget on the home screen showing the next departure for a favorited route and destination.

Dynamic Route Preview: When searching for a destination, the app displays not just the route, but also shows potential delays, crowdedness predictions, and even seat availability on upcoming services.

Augmented Reality (AR) Navigation: Users hold up their phone camera, and the app overlays directions (e.g., "Bus Stop 30m Ahead," "Train Platform 7") on the real-world view.

Integrated Ticketing & Fare Management: Users can purchase tickets, top up their transport card, and view fare history directly within the app, with saved payment methods.

Offline Route Planning: Allows users to plan journeys and view downloaded maps even without an internet connection, crucial for areas with poor signal.

Crowd-Sourced Incident Reporting: A feature for users to report delays, overcrowding, or cleanliness issues, providing real-time community updates.

Personalized Notification Hub: A dedicated section for alerts relevant to the user's saved routes, frequently used lines, or current location (e.g., "Bus #12 delayed by 5 mins").

Multi-Modal Journey Planner: Integrates various transport options (bus, train, tram, bike-share, walk) into a single journey plan, showing estimated times and costs for each leg.

## User Personas
Sarah – Daily Commuter, Age 28

Need: Efficient and reliable real-time tracking for her daily bus and train commute.

### User Story 1:
As a daily commuter, I want to see the exact real-time location of my bus and train, so that I can time my departure from home perfectly and avoid waiting in the cold.

Ben – Occasional Traveler/Tourist, Age 35

Need: Easy-to-understand route planning for unfamiliar areas and clear fare information.

### User Story 2: 
As an occasional traveler, I want to easily find the best route to a new destination, including fare estimates, so that I can navigate the city confidently without getting lost or overpaying.

Maria – Student, Age 20

Need: Affordable travel options and quick access to student pass information.

### User Story 3:
As a student, I want to quickly view my student travel pass balance and find the cheapest route options, so that I can manage my budget effectively.

David – Parent with Children, Age 42

Need: Information on crowdedness and accessibility for strollers.

### User Story 4: 
As a parent traveling with young children, I want to know how crowded a bus or train is likely to be and if it's wheelchair/stroller accessible, so that I can plan a comfortable journey for my family.

Elena – Night Shift Worker, Age 55

Need: Reliable late-night transport schedules and safety features.

### User Story 5:
As a night shift worker, I want to easily check late-night bus and train schedules and access emergency contacts, so that I feel safe and confident returning home after dark.

## Scenario: Sarah's Morning Rush
Selected User Story: User Story 1: "As a daily commuter, I want to see the exact real-time location of my bus and train, so that I can time my departure from home perfectly and avoid waiting in the cold."

## Narrative:

It's 8:00 AM on a chilly Tuesday morning. Sarah, 28, is having her coffee, trying to mentally prepare for another busy day at work. Her bus usually arrives around 8:15 AM, but lately, it's been unpredictable. Standing at the bus stop for 10 minutes in the cold is the last thing she wants to do.

She picks up her smartphone, a slight frown on her face. She opens the public transport app. Her "Morning Commute" widget on the home screen immediately shows her favorited Route 14 bus. A small map displays the bus icon, clearly indicating it's three stops away, estimated to arrive in 7 minutes. "Perfect," she thinks, a small smile forming. That gives her just enough time to finish her coffee and grab her bag.

She quickly checks the next step of her journey – the train. A quick tap on the train icon reveals that her usual 8:30 AM train is running on time. Feeling relieved and in control, Sarah finishes her coffee, knowing exactly when she needs to head out the door. The anxiety about missing her transport or waiting unnecessarily has evaporated.

## Tasks Performed:

Opens the public transport app.

Accesses personalized "Morning Commute" widget/dashboard.

Views real-time location and estimated arrival of her bus.

Checks the status of her next connection (train).

Plans her departure based on real-time data.

## Emotional Journey:

Starts: Slightly stressed, anxious about unpredictability.

During: Focused, relieved as clear information is presented.

After: Calm, confident, in control, and reassured.

## Result:
To practice solution ideation, user story creation, scenario development, flow mapping, and information architecture design to improve user experience through structured UX design activities is done successfully.
